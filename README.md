# STL style
## Purpose
This is a meme library aimed to emulate the standard library of C++, especially the containers and algorithms to dive deeper into data structure / algorithm. And also a attempt to use OOP in Standard C (though it is a total disaster to implement it in C).

## License
    >implying anyone gives a flying fuck about this shit
As always, the most strict possible, AGPL-v3, and v3 only.

## Implementation Status
Nothing so far lmao
